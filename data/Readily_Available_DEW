The HELIOS system uses a modular power and fiber-optic configuration that can be expanded to fire at between 60 and 120 kW. Besides drone and missile defense, it also performs long range surveillance (ISR) and sensor dazzling. Its purported advantages are high precision, efficient "cost to kill", and power capacity for multiple shots.[1] As of 2024, higher-power laser weapons in the 150 to 300 kW range are being tested against anti-ship cruise missiles
	at targets up to five miles away

2: ODIN- Optical Dazzling Interdictor Navy laser system

a solid-state laser system, is designed primarily to counter and neutralize the sensors on UAS, effectively blinding them without destroying the aircraft. Technical 		aspects of the ODIN system include its ability to emit a high-intensity laser beam, targeting the optical sensors of enemy drones.
	has an effective range of about one mile
