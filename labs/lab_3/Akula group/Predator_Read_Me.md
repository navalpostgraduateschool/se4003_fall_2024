## Remaining Questions

1. What are the expected atmospheric conditions in which the laser system will be operated?  Understanding factors like rain, fog, dust, and temperature will help optimize the software for different environments (for example, what anticipated climate for a specific region, or expecting worldwide deployment).

1. What level of automation does the user desire for the laser system?

2. Would they prefer manual control, semi-autonomous operation, or fully autonomous targeting and firing?

1. What specific data points and feedback mechanisms are most critical for the user to monitor during laser operation? This might include target information, laser status, power levels, cooling system performance, and recharge status.
