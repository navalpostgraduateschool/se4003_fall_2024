## Specs
| Specification    | Details                                                                                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Laser Power**   | 100 kW to 300 kW (higher for drones with heat-resistant or reflective coatings)             |
| **Dwell Time**    | 10 to 15 seconds to effectively disable the drone                                           |
| **Size**          | Not explicitly stated; typically large due to power generation, energy storage, and cooling needs |
| **Range**         | Effectiveness decreases with distance; higher power required for longer ranges               |
| **Targeting**     | Focus on critical areas:                                                                    |
|                   | - Sensitive electronics                                                                       |
|                   | - Engines                                                                                     |
|                   | - Fuel tanks                                                                                  |
|                   | - Wings or body (to disrupt aerodynamics)                                                    |
| **Examples**      | - **Helios Laser System**: 60 kW, effective against small/medium drones (1-2 km range)     |
|                   | - **ATHENA**: 30 kW fiber laser; higher power (100 kW) for larger drones (10 seconds)       |
|                   | - **LWSD**: 150 kW, designed for larger drones; 10-15 seconds to engage                      |


## Remaining Questions

1. What are the expected atmospheric conditions in which the laser system will be operated? Understanding factors like rain, fog, dust, and temperature will help optimize the software for different environments (for example, what anticipated climate for a specific region, or expecting worldwide deployment).
 
1. What level of automation does the user desire for the laser system? Would they prefer manual control, semi-autonomous operation, or fully autonomous targeting and firing?
 
1. What specific data points and feedback mechanisms are most critical for the user to monitor during laser operation? This might include target information, laser status, power levels, cooling system performance, and recharge status.
