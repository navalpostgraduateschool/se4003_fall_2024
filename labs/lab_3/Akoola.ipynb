    "# Lab 03: Lasers to Kill Sharks\n",
    "This lab investigates the feasibility of designing a directed energy weapon (DEW, or a laser) to shoot down enemey drones in purpose of protecting friendly ground and naval forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**:\n",
    "- Determine likely drone threats that DEWs could defeat\n",
    "- Determine power load requirements for different engagement models\n",
    "- Analyze operational impacts such as shot count, recharge time, and breaking points for the system\n",
    "  \n",
    "*Rapid kill capability and high kill probability* is **critical** for an effective DEW employment against threat drone targets.\n"
