        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m Mallard Max, a male mallard duck living in the stunning central California region near Monterey. After being left behind by my flock during their migration south, Iâ€™ve set out to explore the beauty of my surroundings and learn more about this vibrant environment.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Being a lone duck has its challenges, but it has also opened up new opportunities. One of my biggest goals right now is to learn how to write code for a software class at school. Yes, this duck is determined to quack out some code! ðŸ¦†ðŸ’»

        <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
        <p>
            You might wonder why a mallard like me is interested in coding. Technology is a powerful tool for conservation and education! By learning to code, I can connect with other wildlife enthusiasts and help create solutions that promote awareness of the natural world.
