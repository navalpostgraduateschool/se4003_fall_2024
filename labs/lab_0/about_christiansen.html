	<h2>My name is Hank Christiansen</h2>
	<p> This is my first time creating an HTML file, and I'll use this to introduce myself.  I'm an Army Officer at NPS completing a master's degree in Systems Engineering Management.  I am married to Danica, and we have two children: Millie is 5, and Cooper is almost 3.  We love Monterey and are excited to move to Orland after graduation. 
Here's a picture of my family: </p>
